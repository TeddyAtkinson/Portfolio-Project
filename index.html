     <h2><strong>Breaking Into Tech:</strong></h2>
     <p>I graguated high school in 2020 and began college in the fall and had decided on playing football in college. Unhappy with my business major, and the wear on my body from sports, I knew something needed to change. Talking it over with my family, my brother urged me to give computer science a try. The following semester I took my first ever computer science class and loved it. However loving computer science I still faced the trouble of hating my other general education classes. My brother, a dev ops engineer already, told me about a bootcamp called epicodus and said, "If I could have done school over again I would have picked a bootcamp from the beginning." So once again taking his advice I enrolled in epicodus for the next year to began my now coding journey.</p>
